Introduction
● These are the specific types of binary trees.
● These are inspired by the binary search algorithm.
● Time complexity on insertion, deletion, and searching reduces significantly as
it works on the principle of binary search rather than linear search, as in the
case of normal binary trees (will discuss it further).

Binary Search Tree Property
In binary search trees, all the left subtree elements should be less than root data
and all the right subtree elements should be greater than root data. This is called
Binary Search Tree property.
● The left subtree of a node ONLY contains nodes with keys less than the
node’s key.
● The right subtree of a node ONLY contains nodes with keys greater than the
node’s key.
● Both the left and right subtrees must also be binary search trees.
Note: The BST property should be satisfied at every node in the tree.
